# Talentvis Tech Challenge

## Design pattern
Native PHP with OOP, folder structures :
1. Controller - communicate view/UI with the services  
2. Services - Bussiness logic for data manipulation 
3. Dto (Data transfer object) - to transfer data between controller and services
4. Helper - Helper classes
5. Responder - for sending response from controller to view/UI
6. views - User Interface

## Behind The Design
The rules are create challenge one by one and the next challenges must be continue from the previous challenge,
so All logic is depend on previous challenge and should not breaking any previous code


## Development Server

Start the development server on http://localhost:808

```bash
sudo php -S localhost:808
```
